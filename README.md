**16AA AddOns** is an Arma 3 AddOns pack containing scripts and modules.

The project is entirely **open-source** and all contributions are welcome. Feel free to maintain your own custom version, so long as the changes you make are open to the public in accordance with the GNU General Public License ([GPLv2](https://github.com/16AAModTeam/16AA/blob/master/LICENSE)).

The mod is **built modularly**, so almost any included PBO can be easily removed from the configuration. This way, a team can maintain its own tailored version of 16AA AddOns by simply excluding any components they don't need, or those possibly in conflict with other add-ons. Modules themselves, e.g. the medical system, also include various customization options, allowing mission designers to tweak the overall experience.

#### Contributing
You can help out with the ongoing development by looking for potential bugs in our code base, or by contributing new features. To contribute something to 16AA AddOns, simply fork this repository and submit your pull requests for review by other collaborators. Remember to add yourself to the author array of any PBO you will be editing and the [`AUTHORS.txt`](https://github.com/16AAModTeam/16AA/blob/master/AUTHORS.txt) file; including a valid email address.

Please, use our [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/16AAModTeam/16AA/issues) to report a bug, propose a feature, or suggest changes to the existing ones.

#### Testing & building
To help us test the latest development changes, download our master branch ([directly](https://github.com/16AAModTeam/16AA/archive/master.zip), or [with git](https://help.github.com/articles/fetching-a-remote/)), then assemble a test build.
For this, we maintain the same build environment and steps as ACE3, but instead of ACE it is named 16AA.

* [Setting up the development environment](http://ace3mod.com/wiki/development/setting-up-the-development-environment.html) â€“ step-by-step instructions on how to properly setup and build a version of ACE3. Same steps apply for 16AA AddOns.
